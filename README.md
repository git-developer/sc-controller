## Packages

Linux:
  - **Arch Linux:** Found in [AUR/sc-controller](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sc-controller/) and [AUR/sc-controller-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sc-controller-git/)
  - **Ubuntu (22.04-jammy, 24.04-noble):** Packaged as AppImage in [GitHub releases](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases), ***which may also run fine on other operating systems - jammy image is currently the most compatible one***
  - **Gentoo:** Packaged as [game-util/sc-controller](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/games-util/sc-controller)
  - **Void Linux:** Packaged as [sc-controller](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages/blob/master/srcpkgs/sc-controller/template) - Run `xbps-install -S sc-controller` in a terminal, points to archived Ryochan7's fork at the time of writing
  - **Others:** You can attempt to use one of the AppImages (try all, AppImages built on older distributions tend to work better), or a package meant for your parent distribution if applicable. Flatpak is planned.

Windows:
  - It should be possible to get it running as per the [upstream wiki](https://github.com/kozec/sc-controller/wiki/Running-SC-Controller-on-Windows), but this is untested and might be broken, report a bug if so

  - [python-ioctl-opt](https://pypi.org/project/ioctl-opt/)
  - [gtk-layer-shell](https://github.com/wmww/gtk-layer-shell)

### Installing
  - Download and extract [latest release](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases/latest)
  - `python3 setup.py build`
  - `python3 setup.py install`

### Docker
A test build with Docker can be created using the following way:

```bash
docker build -o build-output --build-arg BASE_CODENAME=noble .
```

## Running with non distro-specific package
  - Download and extract [latest release](https://github.com/C0rn3j/sc-controller/releases/latest)
  - Navigate to extracted directory: `cd sc-controller`
  - If you do not wish to use system dependencies, you can setup a venv and install them there:
    - Create the venv: `python -m venv venv`
    - Activate it, you will need to do this before each launch: `source venv/bin/activate`
    - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Execute `./run.sh`
  - If you are debuggin an issue, running `./run.sh daemon` first will launch the daemon in debug mode, allowing you to launch sc-controller in another terminal with `./run.sh`
